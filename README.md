# challenge-module-6: Weather Dashboard

This Weather Dashboard includes...
* A search function to search for the weather of any city
* Present and future conditions for the city searched
* Current weather conditions for the searched city presents the city name, date, an icon of the weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index
* The UV index will be either green (favourable conditions), yellow (moderate conditions), or red (severe conditions)
* A five day forecast will be presented for that city, displaying the date, an icon of the weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, and humidity
* Clicking on a city in the search history will present current and future weather conditions for that city
